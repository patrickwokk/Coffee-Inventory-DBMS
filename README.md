# Coffee Inventory DBMS
The goal of this project is to understand and practice using a high-level language (Python) to interact with a database via ODBC. This program truns from the command line. It interacts with an end-user to insert, delete, and update records as well as handle queries on the data

1) Find all suppliers and coffees names for a given country
2) Add a new supplier with item(s) that they provide, then show who else provides such item(s)
3) List all items sold by a particular employee
4) Update Item
5) Quit
